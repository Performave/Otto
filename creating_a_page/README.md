:::danger WARNING
These instructions assume you have already read all the **CORE CONCEPTS**

If you don't understand what whitespace or typography is, please make sure to read them.

## Step 1

Create a **heading 2** text label and make sure it's placed at exactly **X: 0, Y: 131**

## Step 2
Compare and double check the properties (font, size, color) of the text label. Use image below to verify properties.

## Step 3
Create the main body (or description)

You can make this by clicking the **+ symbol on the left** -> **text** -> **themed text** -> **paragraph** (I'm a paragraph...)

## Step 4

It's time to make sure your new page is mobile compliant ðŸ“²

Visit **"Mobile Responsiveness"** in the **"Core Concepts"** for more information.

Make sure there is adequate whitespace between elements vertically and make sure buttons are large enough so it would be easy to tap on them.

## Step 5 (extra)

Here's an example of sub headings and sub-sub headings

# Conclusion

Congratulations!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰


But most importantly, I wanted to get across the idea that everything you make on the website **should** be **pragmatic**. You are designing a website the way the visitors want to see it.
