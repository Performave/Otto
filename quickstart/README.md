# Introduction
Otto is a design language for [OKTSA](https://oktsa.org) created by Eric Wang.

This design language was written because the OKTSA website was created in the [Wix website builder](https://wix.com), which allows people to easily create websites without any web design experience.

Unfortunately, with this freedom, it's easy for people to violate web standards and create a website they think look "best" when, in fact, it makes it **harder** for visitors to navigate the website. What's even worse is that people who have disabilities (color blindness, visual impairment, etc) can have a hard time trying to learn more about OKTSA.
