# Introduction
Otto is a design language for [OKTSA](https://oktsa.org) created by Eric Wang.

This design language was written to define boundaries for maintaining the current OKTSA website on [Wix](https://wix.com).

Wix allows users to drag and drop elements anywhere in the website and customize it the way they want it. However, this freedom can also make it very easy to create inconsistent design that is incompliant with modern web standards.
