# Mobile Responsiveness

Let's say you just designed a new page. It looks fantastic, and it follows all my standards and guidelines ðŸ¤—.

BUT WAIT!

You opened it on your phone, and it looked like some random art by Picasso or Van Gogh.


**Use the mobile view feature in the Wix editor to rearrange the content**

### Why?
This is because mobile responsiveness **does not exist** in Wix.

To explain it better: imagine you have a large textbook (12" x 9"), and you want to bring it with you on a road trip. Your parents, [Wix.com](https://wix.com), says it's too big to fit in a space (10" x 5"), so what they do is chop off the overlapping sections of the book so it fits in the space.
Sure, it gets the job done. But in practice, the textbook is unreadable.

# Best Practices
### Formatting text
Continue to align all the text to the **LEFT** just like you did in desktop mode.
Do not center as it breaks consistency.

### Whitespace
Ensure that there is still adequate whitespace between paragraphs of text, titles, and buttons.

### Footer
Hover your mouse at the TOP border of the footer, and you should see a button to DRAG the footer down.
You basically want WHITESPACE between the content and the footer.

# Examples
## Good

::: tip Good
Plenty of whitespace is used without taking up TOO much space.
The visitor doesn't feel claustrophobic, and it also looks visually appealing ðŸ˜„.

:::tip Good
Plenty of whitespace is used to distinguish the text from the buttons AND the content OVERALL from the footer.

## Bad

:::danger BAD
There is no whitespace. Also, the title is aligned to the **CENTER**, which breaks the consistency of aligning to the **LEFT**.
