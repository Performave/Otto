# Whitespace
Hey, it's **{insert current year}**. 

We have have phones that are almost **triple** the size of the **original iPhone in 2007.**
From this, we can use the extra room to organize and space out content

# Best Practices

 - On the **Y axis**, between text or elements (buttons, boxes, etc), ADD space between them. 
	 -  Do not try to cram them in the least amount of vertical space possible like making a **"cheatsheet"** notecard for your science exam!
 - Use less space between titles and paragraphs that are talking about the same thing

 - Use MORE space between blocks of texts that are talking about something different
