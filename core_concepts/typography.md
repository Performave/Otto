# Typography

Typography is crucial when designing a website.

It's really easy to choose a color and fontsize that doesn't create contrast, which makes it hard for visitors to understand the visual hierarchy.

# Text types
| Type | Size (pixels) | Color (hex) | Font | Uses |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| Heading | 40 | #DC2626 | Manrope Bold | Page name ONLY |
| Subheading | 40 | #000000 | Manrope Regular | Organizing content (contact info, submission, requirements, etc) |
| Sub-sub heading | 30 | #000000 | Manrope Regular | For information that can be grouped together under a subheading (see the second "good" example) |
| Paragraph Text (normal) | 16 | #2B2E38 | Manrope Regular | Usually goes below headings, subheadings, and sub-sub headings |

Only use the font **MANROPE**

# Formatting
For formatting, I only allow **ALIGN LEFT** for EVERYTHING because it's consistent with the whole design of all the pages, and most people read from left to right (except people who read Arabic).

# Examples

## Good

::: tip Good
^ Above the text **"Competitive Event Information"** has the property red (#DC2626), font **Manrope Bold**, and font size **40 pixels**. 

Below it **"Middle School"** and **"High School"** are using font **Manrope Regular**, property black (#000), and font size **40 pixels**.

It's easy to know where to look, and it's also visually pleasing.

::: tip Good
This is a great example of sub-sub heading because **"Eastern Region Advisors" and "Western Region Advisors"** are basically the same thing, so they can be grouped together in a sub-sub heading.

ONLY use sub heading when it's completely different information on the same page!!

## Bad (STAY AWAY!!!)

::: danger BAD
^ Above, all the subheadings and heading use the same red color.
Next, all the sub headings are small and the same size as the paragraph texts. This is bad because it creates very **LITTLE** visual hierarchy ([try reading a newspaper from the 1800s!](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Nytrib1864.jpg/400px-Nytrib1864.jpg)).
