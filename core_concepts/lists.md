# Lists

When creating a list (long or short), you want to make it that visitors don't have to scrutinize the list in order to find what they need.

In other words, make it less painful as possible.

# Best Practices

 - For many list items such as the competitive events on the competitive events page, USE A TABLE. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE FOR
 - Use bullet points like this!
 - Indent your bullet points so it looks different from REST of the blocks of text

## Bad

![Bad example](https://imgur.com/rcQnuQa.png)

The reason why this is bad is because **it looks like a block of text**.

You may ask: Eric, this is the new website, why didn't you fix it?
It's because I have to **format. Every. Single. Link.**

This means before you make a list, try to make it work in the **long-term**.
