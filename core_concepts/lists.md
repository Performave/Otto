# Lists

When creating a list (long or short), you want to make it that visitors don't have to scrutinize the list in order to find what they need.

In other words, make it as convenient as possible.

# Best Practices

 - For many list items such as the competitive events on the competitive events page, use a table.
 - Use bullet points like this!
 - Indent your bullet points so it looks different from REST of the blocks of text

The reason why this is bad is because **it looks like a block of text**.

You may ask: Eric, this is the new website, why didn't you fix it?
It's because there's too many links & elements. 

With the limitations of Wix, it makes it harder for me, a professional web developer, to customize it.

This means before you make a list, consider using something better suited for all of those links (i.g. table).
